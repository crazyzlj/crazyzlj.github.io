<li><p><b>Accept after minor revision (Academic Editor)</b>: 2019-01-18</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Review by academic editor: <b>I believe the work presented here has scientific merit and
very useful to the professional modeling community.</b> Please refer to the comments made by
reviewers 1 and 2 and make necessary revisions to the manuscript.</p>
</li></ul>

<li><p><b>Major revision (Assistant Editor)</b>: 2019-01-20</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reviewer #1: This is <b>a well-written and well-organized manuscript</b> evaluating the effects
of spatial configuration units of BMPs on soil loss using optimization methods using the
modeling approach. The authors have used the spatial configuration units as a basis to evaluate
where in the watershed BMPs should be placed to reduce its impact on downstream water quality.
<b>This paper is of great benefit to the scientific community in general</b>, and to the forest and
agricultural managers who will be relying on modeling tools to support management activities
under future land use and climate change. <b>The introduction is very well written. The authors
give a comprehensive of BMP optimization schemes previously used in such studies and their
limitations.</b> The goal and specific questions are clearly defined. The method section describes
their approach well and aligns well with results section. The QSWAT model used for this study
could prove to be a promising tool for decision making. <u>I have minor editorial suggestions.</u></p>
</li>
<li><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript compared the effectiveness of four ways to link BMPs to land
characteristics during optimization. <b>The results were well presented and can direct the work
of BMP placement in the future.</b> The work has its merits, <u>but issues were found that can have
serious negative impact to its acceptance by academia. The main problem of this manuscript is
its organization.</u> The author preferred to provide a rough and generalized description first,
and then provide more details in a later section. This is not wrong, but the general description
is often too generalized that readers cannot understand what the description actually referred to.
This is particular serious before section 2.3 (but later sections also have this problem).
The general description must contain enough information and definition so readers can understand
it right away without referring to other parts of the manuscript. If detailed information must be
left in a later section, the general description should contain a &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; to point readers to
the correct section (e.g. &ldquo;section x.x contains more detailed information about xxx&rdquo;) that contains
detailed information. <u>The second problem (which is related to the first problem) is that many
terms were not defined when they were used the first time in the manuscript</u>. For example, the
abstract is very hard to read because of all the <u>undefined terms such as &ldquo;spatial unit&rdquo;</u>. The
<u>abstract and the introduction parts must be reorganized</u>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reviewer #3: his is <b>a solid piece of work addressing the watershed best management practice
(BMP) scenarios optimization with regard to effectiveness, optimizing efficiency, and practicality</b>
by comparing different BMP configuration units based on one same watershed. The manuscript is <b>written
clearly and highlights the need for research on this topic</b>. The authors provide <b>sufficient methodological
detail and the research findings are robust with practical implications</b>.</p>

<li><p><b>Major revision (From reviewer #2)</b>: 2019-01-25</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for providing an updated copy of the manuscript. The reviewer saw a
lot of improvements, but issues still exist. <b>This manuscript has good technical merit, so I would
really like to see it published with improved writing</b>. <u>I would seriously suggest the authors to
refine writing in the manuscript</u>. One of the authors lives in the U.S., and I highly recommend
him/her (and/or his/her American colleagues) to review the manuscript for clarity.</p>
