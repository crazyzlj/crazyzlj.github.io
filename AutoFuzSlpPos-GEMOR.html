<h1>Automatic approach for deriving fuzzy slope positions</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Spatial gradation information of slope positions (e.g., ridge, backslope, and footslope)
is important for terrain-related geographical or ecological modeling. <b>The quantification
of such gradation information is the so-called fuzzy slope positions</b>.</p>
<p>Among existing methods for deriving fuzzy slope positions, the prototype-based inference
method is more reasonable because of not only its inference in both spatial and attribute
domain but also its use of the typical locations as prototypes, which inherently contain
the characteristics of the slope position distribution in a study area. <b>However, its
practicability is currently limited due to the extensive manual operations and parameter-settings,
such as preparing topographic attributes as input, finding prototypes of slope positions,
and setting parameters for fuzzy inference</b>.</p>
<p>This study proposed an approach to automate the whole workflow of the prototype-based method.
Instead of being determined totally by users in the original method, in the proposed approach
the typical locations and the fuzzy inference parameters for each slope position type can be
automatically determined based on the common expert knowledge and data mining. Furthermore,
the preparation of necessary topographic attributes is automated, which means that the proposed
automatic approach needs only one necessary input, i.e. the gridded DEM of the study area.
The proposed approach is implemented as a configurable Python script to organize the workflow,
in which all of the compute-intensive procedures are speeded up by parallel computing based on
message passing interface (MPI).
Case studies shows that this approach can derive fuzzy slope positions reasonably and efficiently.</p>
<p>Similar to the prototype-based method for deriving fuzzy slope positions, many other geospatial
analysis methods currently also need manual operations and parameter setting processes for carrying
out a workﬂow in practice. These processes are tedious for users and selecting reasonable parameter
values is not only subjective but also error-prone. This study shows an example of designing automatic
approach for geospatial analysis method, in which the parameter-settings can be automatically
determined by the combination of expert knowledge (e.g., the curve shapes of FMFs for individual
topographic attributes, and parameter settings related to RPI [Relative Position Index]) and data
mining techniques (e.g., FMF parameter estimation based on the frequency of topographic
attribute values in candidate areas of typical locations). The parallel computing technique can be
used to achieve high computational efﬁciency for such automatic, but compute-intensive workﬂow.
<b>The basic idea in the proposed approach is potentially useful for automation of other similar
geospatial analysis methods.</b></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reviewer: This paper presents <b>an interesting approach to automatize the overall workflow of the
prototype-based inference method developed by
<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169555X0900155X" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Qin <i>et al</i>., (2009)</a>
for deriving slope position typologies
(i.e., ridge, shoulder slope, backslope, footslope, and valley)</b>. The basic idea is to overcome the
limitations of the prototype-based inference method for deriving fuzzy membership values that are mainly
due to the &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; assignment of the user of a set of explicit rules for each slope position type.
<b>The methodological approach is quite original and its implementation, freely available on the web, surely
represents an interesting tool for the scientific community</b>. However, I have some concerns about the
structure of the manuscript. Several parts of the text are dedicated the description of the methodology
but a chapter dealing with the comparison with other methods of classification and related discussion
citing international literature is completely missing. Despite the long text describing the approach
some essential information is poorly presented (e.g. which algorithms are used to derive slope and
profile curvature?). Moreover, in my opinion in its present form, the manuscript seems more suitable
for a journal focused on computer science in geoscience (e.g., chapter 4 dedicated to the description
of the implementation, the computational efficiency used as evaluation methods) than for a journal as
<i>Geomorphology</i>. This could be addressed by <u>reducing the text related to the technical issues as
computational efficiency, strengthening the case study part maybe comparing the results of the approach
with an expert classification and drafting a discussion chapter as mentioned above</u>.</p>

<li><p>Reviewer: The authors have made a great effort to address most of the issues raised in my previous
reviews and the manuscript has been improved. In particular, I appreciate the authors’ effort in revising
and reorganizing the manuscript in order to <b>highlight the geomorphometric approach devised in their work,
reducing the information on the implementation and, thus, making the manuscript more suitable for a journal
as <i>Geomorphology</i> and its readers</b>.</p>
